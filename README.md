Getting to class on time
??maybe specifically for college campuses??

Right now it is a little shaky. 
Need to add: 
- a way of adding and removing classes
- specifying semesters or something similar
- colored background based on the class or how mmuch time is left

a bit further in the future would be some way of determining how long it actually takes to get to class so there is an alert that says go to class now.

Thats all for now.
